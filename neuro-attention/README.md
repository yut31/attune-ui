# neuro-attention

Neuro-steered hearing: read which of two talkers a listener is attending to from
their EEG, and amplify that talker in real time.

**Start here:** [`docs/PROJECT.md`](docs/PROJECT.md) — the full explanation, product pitch,
viability results, and demo architecture in one document.

**Status:** viability proven on real data (mean 82% at a 60 s window, up to 90%);
real-time demo runs today with no hardware via EEG replay.

```

All the `.py` files in `src/` are still flat siblings of each other — moving them together here
didn't require changing a single `import` statement. Run them as `python src/<name>.py` from
this folder (the launchers already do this); output still lands in the top-level `results/`.

## The demo front-end

The showable demo is `live_demo.py`: it opens a browser page with two "Talker" cards
where the one the listener is attending to lights up and is amplified, driven live by
the decoder. Runs today on any laptop with recorded EEG — no headset needed.

```bash
# double-click run_live_demo.command, or:
python src/live_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD                 # recorded EEG + two tracks
python src/live_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD --audio file --files A.wav B.wav
python src/live_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD --audio mic     # two clip-on mics
python src/live_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD --eeg lsl --audio mic   # build day, live
python src/render_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD               # -> results/demo_video.mp4
```

Live sound needs `sounddevice`; live EEG needs `mne-lsl` (both optional, in
`requirements.txt`). Add `--no-audio` to run the visual without playing sound.

### Two ways to run it live (choose per demo)

The decoder must be tuned to a brain. You have both options ready — pick with
`live_demo.py --decoder <file>`:

```bash
# 1) INSTANT, zero calibration — a generic decoder built from several people ahead of time.
python src/pretrain_generic.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD --subjects P1 P2 P3   # once, on your rig
python src/live_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD --decoder results/generic_decoder.npy

# 2) STRONGER, ~3 min personalize — calibrate on the specific listener, then run.
python src/calibrate.py  --data-dir /path/to/AAD --eeg lsl --minutes 3 --files A.wav B.wav
python src/live_demo.py  --data-dir /path/to/AAD --decoder results/personal_decoder.npy
```

Measured trade-off (`results/calibration_analysis.png`): generic ≈ 72% at a 60 s
window with **no** wait; personalized reaches ~82%+ but needs a few minutes. **1 minute
of calibration is worse than the generic decoder — don't do it.** Use generic for
walk-up judges, personalize for a hero demo.

## Get the data (not committed — too large)

Download the subject files and `stimuli.zip` from
<https://zenodo.org/records/4004271> and arrange:

```
AAD/
├── S1.mat  S2.mat  S3.mat      # subject EEG
└── stimuli/ … *.wav            # unzip stimuli.zip here
```

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1) reproduce the viability result (writes results/)
python src/run_viability.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD

# 2) sanity-check controls
python src/verify.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD

# 3) the real-time demo — today, no hardware (renders demo_output.wav):
python src/demo_realtime.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD --subject S3 --trial 4 --output wav

# 3b) build day — live headset + live mics + live playback:
python src/demo_realtime.py --data-dir /path/to/AAD --eeg lsl --audio mic --output play
```

All tunables (decision window, ducking dB, gain ramp, hysteresis) live in
`src/config.py`. See `docs/PROJECT.md` for the day-of setup and the honest scope on the
audio front-end, and **[`docs/BUILD_DAY.md`](docs/BUILD_DAY.md)** for exactly what's tested vs.
what to integrate with the ANT Neuro headset on the day.

> **Tested:** the analysis and the replay demo (no hardware). **Needs on-rig
> integration:** live audio out, live mics, and live EEG over LSL — including a short
> decoder **calibration on the ANT Neuro cap** (KU-Leuven-trained weights don't
> transfer channel-for-channel to a different amplifier). See `docs/BUILD_DAY.md`.
