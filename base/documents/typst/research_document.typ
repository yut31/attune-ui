  == COG-BCI Dataset
  The *COG-BCI database* #cite(<hinss_2022_6874129>) is a multi-session, multi-task EEG dataset designed for research on *passive brain-computer interfaces* (pBCI). Each subject performed the same battery of cognitive tasks across three sessions while *$63$ EEG channels* were recorded at *$500$ Hz* with a *common-average reference*. For every condition, the dataset also provides trial-level *behavioral logs*, which makes it possible to align neural activity with overt performance.

  === Dataset Structure
  The local copy follows a *BIDS-like layout*, organized per subject (`sub-XX`) and session (`ses-S1`--`ses-S3`):
  - `eeg/` -- raw EEGLAB files (`.set` header + `.fdt` binary data) for each condition;
  - `behavioral/` -- trial-level behavioral logs (`.mat`) mirroring the same conditions;
  - `chanlocs/` -- channel names and 3D coordinates.
  Each session contains the same task battery: the N-back task (0/1/2-back), the Flanker task, the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB), the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), and resting-state blocks (eyes open / eyes closed) at the start and end of the session.

  === Structure of Data on Psychomotor Vigilance Task
  The *Psychomotor Vigilance Task* (PVT) is a classic *sustained-attention* paradigm. Participants watch a screen and press a button as soon as a stimulus appears. Stimuli are presented at *pseudo-random inter-stimulus intervals* of $2$--$10$ s, so the task cannot be solved by rhythm or anticipation; performance therefore tracks the current level of vigilance.\
  The primary outcome is the *reaction time* (RT) on each trial. Slow responses and *lapses* are the hallmark of reduced vigilance, which is observed under sleepiness, fatigue, and *mind wandering*. When the mind wanders, attention is diverted away from the stimulus, so the participant reacts late or not at all -- precisely the lapse signature that the PVT measures. PVT performance is therefore a standard *behavioral proxy* for mind-wandering episodes, and, combined with the simultaneously recorded EEG, it allows searching for the neural correlates of attentional drift.\
  The PVT EEG is stored in *EEGLAB format*: a `.set` header file together with a `.fdt` binary file that holds the raw samples. Inspecting the MATLAB struct of `PVT.set` gives the following picture:

  ```matlab
  EEG =
    filename: 'PVT.set'   datfile: 'PVT.fdt'
    nbchan:  63           trials: 1
    pnts:    306060       srate:  500
    xmin:    0            xmax:   612.118
    data:    [63×306060 single]
    ref:     'common'
    event:   [272×1 struct]
  ```
  The various fields have the following meaning:
  - `nbchan: 63`, `srate: 500` -- the recording contains *$63$ EEG channels* sampled at *$500$ Hz*.
  - `trials: 1`, `pnts: 306060`, `xmax: 612.118` -- a *single continuous recording* of $306060$ sample points, i.e. roughly *$612$ seconds ($approx 10.2$ minutes)*, that is *not* segmented into epochs.
  - `data: [63×306060 single]` -- the raw amplitude values (in microvolts, single-precision floats) laid out as *channels × time points*.
  - `ref: 'common'` -- the signal has already been *average-referenced*.
  - `chanlocs: [1×63 struct]` -- the channel locations, matching `chanlocs/get_chanlocs.txt`.
  - `event: [272×1 struct]` -- event markers for the $90$ PVT trials (stimulus onsets and responses) together with session start/end markers; these events make it possible to *segment the continuous signal into trials*.
  - `datfile: 'PVT.fdt'` -- the companion binary file containing the actual samples.

  === Corrupted Behavioral Log
  The behavioral log `PVT.mat` describes the same $90$ trials at the performance level. In theory, taken together, `PVT.set` / `PVT.fdt` provide the continuous neural signal while `PVT.mat` provides the per-trial behavioral ground truth.
  However, an inspection on the `PVT.mat` files using *MD5* shows that the files seem to be *identical across sessions and subjects*, which is unexpected.\
  A further inspection of the EEG files shows that `sub-17` and `sub-27`, `sub-25` and `sub-28` have identical EEG recordings for the PVT. Those four subjects are removed from the analysis, leaving $25$ subjects with valid data.\
  Since we are training for a model that detects lapses from EEG, we need to have the reaction times for each trial in order to label the trials as *lapse* or *non-lapse*. Hence, we need to *reconstruct the behavioral log* from the EEG event markers.\
  We use the `mne` package to read the EEG files as `raw` and extract the event markers via `raw.annotations`. The event labeled as `13` indicates the *stimulus onset* and the event labeled as `14` indicates the *response*. The difference between the two timestamps gives the *reaction time* for each trial.\

  == Training EEGNet Using the COG-BCI Dataset
  === Data Labeling and Preprocessing
  In order to obtain a clean training set, each PVT trial must be labeled and its EEG segment extracted before being fed to the model. Before labeling, the signal is preprocessed: it is *band-pass filtered between $0.5$ Hz and $45$ Hz*, and the raw values are *multiplied by a factor of $10^6$* so that the amplitudes are expressed in #math.mu\V.\
  We use the `mne` package to read the raw EEG recording as a `Raw` object and extract the event markers through `raw.annotations`. As described above, the annotation labeled `13` marks the *stimulus onset* and the annotation labeled `14` marks the *response*; the difference between the two timestamps gives the *reaction time* of the trial.\
  A trial is labeled as a *lapse* when the participant fails to respond in time. A global threshold such as the classic $500$ ms does not generalize here: an analysis of the data shows that for some participants all reaction times are below $500$ ms. We therefore use a *per-participant, data-driven threshold*: for each participant, the trials whose reaction times fall in the *longest $10%$* are labeled as lapses, and all the others as non-lapses.\
  Since we want the model to learn the neural pattern preceding an attention lapse, the EEG of interest is the one *right before the stimulus*. For every trial we extract the *$2000$ ms of signal ending $100$ ms before the stimulus onset*; the $100$ ms gap ensures the segment does not include the stimulus-evoked response itself.\
  Because the extracted segment sits immediately before the stimulus, it must not be contaminated by the *remnant of the previous response or error trial*. A trial is therefore kept only if the previous response/error happened at least *$2000$ ms + $200$ ms* before the current stimulus onset: $2000$ ms so that the whole segment is clear of the previous event, plus a *$200$ ms buffer* so that any residual activity from the last response/error has time to disappear. Trials that do not satisfy this spacing requirement are discarded.

  === Model Input
  Before being fed to the model, the extracted segments are prepared as input. Depending on the session, the recordings contain *$63$ or $64$ channels*, one of which is an *ECG channel*; we therefore remove that channel, which reduces the data to *$62$ channels* ($63$ to $62$, $64$ to $63$). To keep a single consistent input shape across all subjects and sessions, the network is fed exactly these *$62$ channels*.\
  The raw signal, originally recorded at *$500$ Hz*, is *downsampled to $128$ Hz*. For every trial the model receives *$2$ s of signal* (the $2000$ ms segment ending $100$ ms before the stimulus onset), which corresponds to *$256$ time samples* at $128$ Hz. The final input to the network is therefore a *$62$-channel × $256$-sample* window.

  === Training EEGNet
  The *EEGNet* architecture #cite(<Lawhern_2018>) is a compact convolutional neural network designed for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces. It learns temporal features with regular convolutions and spatial features with *depthwise and separable convolutions*, which makes it well suited to small datasets with limited training data. We *replicated the model in PyTorch*.\
  To obtain an unbiased estimate of cross-subject generalization, we use *leave-one-subject-out* (LOSO) cross-validation. There are *$25$ available subjects* ($4$ out of the original $29$ were removed because their EEG recordings were identical); each fold leaves one subject out, trains the model on the remaining *$24$ subjects*, and evaluates on the held-out subject.\
  Because lapses are the minority class (only the *longest $10%$* of reaction times are labeled as lapses), the training set is imbalanced between the positive (lapse) and negative (non-lapse) trials. To deal with this potential imbalance, we train with *focal loss*, which down-weights the well-classified majority trials so that the model focuses on the harder, minority lapse trials.\
  Since the classes are imbalanced, accuracy would be a misleading metric. We therefore use the *F1 score* to evaluate the model's performance.

  === Result
  - *Multiple Windows*:\
    To increase the amount of training data, we first collected *multiple windows per trial*: *$4$ windows of $2$ s each*, ending at *$100$ ms, $200$ ms, $300$ ms and $400$ ms before the stimulus* in attempt to increase the number of training samples. This augmentation *did not help* the model -- it actually *decreased* the F1 score: as we reduced the number of windows from $4$ to $2$ to $1$, the F1 score increased.

  - *Focal Loss*:\
    We limited the *ratio of positive and negative samples* in the training set and adjusted the focal loss accordingly. *Changing the sample ratio produced no improvement*: for a single window, the F1 score stays around *$0.59$*.
